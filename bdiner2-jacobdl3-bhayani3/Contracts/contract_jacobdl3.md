#Team Contract:

##Communication

Tuesday’s 1-2pm , discord, we will have an assigned recorder (Rushabh)
###Assistance How will your teammates be able to contact you if they need your help or opinion on a task? How quickly should you be expected to respond?
We will be contacting each other through discord, and we will be replying to each other fairly quickly

###Respect 

The google docs are open to edit for anyone. We will make sure everyone has spoken or is OK with our progress. Democratic rule; we need a consensus Vote on important decisions before making anything final. Recorder will keep a log of everyone’s contribution during the meeting. 
##Collaboration

###Work Distribution 

The work will be assigned in a way that 2 people will work on the logic for each Algorithm, and then in that one will be doing the code, while the other will be going over it and optimizing and helping with bugs, this person will also work on the final project deliverables for the logic they worked for, such as presentations and stuff. 

###Time Commitment 

We’ll start with one hour for weekly meetings then increase the expected hours as we start to figure out the scope of our project. If a person isn’t working for two weeks in a row we’ll contact the professor about their lack of effort. If the person has a valid reason for missing, the professor won’t be contacted and we will all be understanding.
###Conflict Resolution 

We’ll try to resolve disagreements by ourselves and be open to change and flexibility regarding work on the project.
